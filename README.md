# Projects

My goal for creating this portfolio is to showcase the core skills that I have developed throughout the process (ETL, database management, and basic analytics).

These projects will provide me with end-to-end experience in handling data from ingestion to analysis.

Phase 1: Foundational Projects
- Data Pipeline for Ingesting Public Safety Data
- Database Schema Design and SQL Optimization
- Data Lake for Storage of Unstructured Data
- Automated Data Cleaning and Transformation Pipeline

Phase 2: Intermediate Projects
- Data Warehousing with Star Schema for Crime Analysis
- Interactive Dashboard Using Tableau and Power BI
- API Development for Public Safety Data Access

Phase 3: Advanced Projects
- Streaming Data with Kafka
- Batch Processing and Aggregation with Apache Spark
- Predictive Modeling for Crime Forecasting
